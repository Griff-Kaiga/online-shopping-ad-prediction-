## 1.Defining the question 
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process.
She wants to identify which individuals are most likely to click ads.

## 2. Metrics of sucess
The project will be considered a success once we are able to provide insights on the group of people who are most likely to click ads 

## 3. Understanding the context
Targeted advertising is a form of advertising, including online advertising, that is directed towards an audience with certain traits, based on the product or person the advertiser is promoting.These traits can either be demographic with a focus on race, economic status, sex, age, generation, level of education, income level, and employment, or there can be a psychographic focus which is based on the consumer values, personality, attitude, opinion, lifestyle and interest. This focus can also entail behavioral variables, such as browser history, purchase history, and other recent online activities. Targeted advertising is focused on certain traits and consumers who are likely to have a strong preference. These individuals will receive messages instead of those who have no interest and whose preferences do not match a particular product's attributes. This eliminates waste.

## 4. Experimental design
loading the data
checking the data
Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Perform  univariate and bivariate analysis

```{r}
# Viewing the datset
advertising <- read.csv("advertising.csv", header = TRUE)
class(advertising)
dim(advertising)

# checking the first six observations
head(advertising)
View(advertising)

# checking the data types
str(advertising)
```
```{r}
# checking for the sum of missing values 
anyNA(advertising)

# checking for outliers values
boxplot(advertising$Age)

# checking for the unique items
unique_items <- advertising[!duplicated(advertising),]
unique_items
```
# There were no missing values in the data.
# As for the boxplot for the column age, majority of the ages were between 30 and 44. The outliers valid since age is can extend to 60 years.
```{r}
# selecting the columns and making them all uniform
colnames(advertising)
names(advertising)[names(advertising) == 'Daily Time Spent on Site'] <- "time_spent"
names(advertising)[names(advertising) == "Daily Internet Usage"] <- "internet_usage"
names(advertising)[names(advertising) == "Clicked on Ad"] <- "clicked_on_ad" 
names(advertising)[names(advertising) == "Ad Topic Line"] <- "ad_topic_line"
names(advertising)[names(advertising) == "Area Income"] <- "area_income"
```
```{r}

## Bivariate Analysis

# determining the covariance
time_spent <- advertising$Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site

# The covariance of time spent and age duration is about -46.17415. It indicates a negative linear relationship between the two variables

# The covariance of time spent amd age duration is about 2.164665. It indicates a positive linear relationship between the two variables

# The covariance of time click on ad and gender is about -0.00950951. It indicates a zero since the click per ad is paired equally with both greater and lesser values of the gender varaible.

# The covariance of click on ad and time spent is about -5.933143. It indicates a negative linear relationship between the two variables

# The covariance of click on ad and internet usage is about  -17.27409. It indicates a negative linear relationship between the two variables

# implementing the solution
## Converting categorical columns to numerical
```{r}
library(dplyr)
columns <- advertising %>% select(c(5, 6, 8))

for (i in 1:length(columns)){
 columns[[i]] <- as.numeric(as.factor(columns[[i]]))
 }
columns
head(advertising)
```

## Implementing the solution
  # Decision Trees
```{r}
# converting the column country, ad.Topic.Line to numeric

advertising$Country <- as.integer(as.factor(advertising$Country))
advertising$Ad.Topic.Line <- as.integer(as.factor(advertising$Ad.Topic.Line))
```

```{r}
# column selection
advertising <- advertising %>% select(1,2,3,4,5,7,8,)

```

```{r}
# normalizing the data
normalize <- function(x){
  return ((x-min(x)) / (max(x)-min(x)))}
advertising$Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site <- normalize(advertising$Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site)
advertising$Age <- normalize(advertising$Age)
advertising$Area.Income <- normalize(advertising$Area.Income)
advertising$Daily.Internet.Usage <- normalize(advertising$Daily.Internet.Usage)
advertising$Country <- normalize(advertising$Country)
```

```{r}

library(rpart)
m <- rpart(Clicked.on.Ad~ ., data=advertising, method="class")
library(rpart.plot)
rpart.plot(m)
```

```{r}

library(caret)
set.seed(1234)

index <- createDataPartition(advertising$Clicked.on.Ad, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
head(index)

ad_test <- advertising[index, ]
ad_train <- advertising[-index, ]

library(e1071)
library(class)
train(Clicked.on.Ad~ ., data=ad_test, method='knn', preProcess=c('center', 'scale') )

knnModel <- train(Clicked.on.Ad~ ., data=ad_test, method='knn', preProcess=c('center', 'scale') )
ad_test$Clicked.on.Ad <- factor(ad_test$Clicked.on.Ad)
knnPred <- predict(knnModel, newdata=ad_test)

confusionMatrix(knnPred, ad_test$Clicked.on.Ad)


# from the results the accuracy score was 96% and from a total of 750 predictions, 371 were the true positive and 355 were classified as true negative
```




## Recomendations 
Emphasis should be on the ages of between 35-45 since they are the majority in the blog.This is evident by the covariant relationship between "click on ad" and age variables.

Squeezing the cryptography course advertisment in the "Cloned 5thgeneration orchestration" ad topic would prove benefitial as evident by the mode of the ad topic line

More emphasis should be put on the country Czech Republic and the city "Lisamouth" as evident by the mode values of both
 
As for the section of prediction, decision trees provided a high and reliable accuracy. Further research should be carried out using other supervised learning methods such as SVM and random forest.
